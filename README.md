## Features

- ðŸŽ® Multiple game modes:
  - Player vs Player
  - Player vs AI
  - AI vs AI
- ðŸ¤– AI with three difficulty levels:
  - Easy (1-ply search)
  - Medium (3-ply search)
  - Hard (5-ply search)
- ðŸŽ¯ Advanced AI using Minimax with Alpha-Beta pruning
- ðŸ’¾ Save/Load game functionality
- ðŸŽ¨ Modern UI with animations
- ðŸ“± Cross-platform support

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Qt 6.0 or higher
- C++17 compatible compiler
- CMake 3.15 or higher

### Building from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/connect6.git
cd connect6

# Create build directory
mkdir build && cd build

# Configure and build
cmake ..
make

# Run the game
./connect6
```

## Game Rules

Connect 6 is a two-player game played on a 15x15 board. Players take turns placing their pieces (black and white) on the board. The first player to create a line of 6 or more pieces in any direction (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) wins the game.

## AI Implementation

The game features an advanced AI opponent that uses:
- Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning
- Pattern recognition for move evaluation
- Center control strategy
- Move ordering optimization

For detailed information about the AI implementation, see [Algorithm Documentation](docs/ALGORITHM.md).
